          To remind as many as we would come across of the love of God for
          mankind, through the sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross (John 3:16) and
          bring to their remembrance that everyone that names the name of the
          Lord should depart from evil (1Tim 2:19) and stick to the commands of
          God as faithful disciples (John 8:31).

        <h1>CONFESSION</h1>
        <p class="spaced">
          For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for
          salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jews first and also to the
          Greeks (Romans 1:16) Father lord, I thank you for the salvation of my
          soul through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ (John 3:16). I thank you
          for the privilege to be in-dwelt and led by the Holy Spirit (John
          1:12). I thank you for saving me from the bondage of sin and giving me
          liberty in Christ Jesus (2Cori 3:17). I thank you for the grace to be
          a labourer in your vineyard, expressing my love to you by fulfilling
          the great commission. Thank you for the grace to yield to the Holy
          Sprit who is working in me to will and to do of your good pleasure
          (Philippians 2:13). Lord God as I step out I am divinely empowered to
          win souls to your kingdom. The Holy Spirit works actively with me and
          as I speak souls are convicted of their sins and are brought under the
          Lordship of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:33). I declare that the bondage of
          sin holding men captive is broken at the name of Jesus and men are
          transformed from darkness into the Kingdom of the Father. I declare
          that my tongue is like the pen of a ready writer and is divinely
          quickened by the holy spirit therefore I do not lack words to speak, I
          speak the words of truth and I speak as directed by the Holy Spirit.
          Thank you Father for I am persuaded that there would be an harvest of
          souls to your kingdom through my obedience, in the name of Jesus.

          <strong>Matthew 10:1–42 (ESV): 10</strong
          ><em
            > And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority
            over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease
            and every affliction. 2 The names of the twelve apostles are these:
            first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the
            son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 3 Philip and Bartholomew;
            Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and
            Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
            5 These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, “Go nowhere among
            the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, 6 but go rather to
            the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7 And proclaim as you go,
            saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ 8 Heal the sick, raise
            the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without
            paying; give without pay. 9 Acquire no gold or silver or copper for
            your belts, 10 no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or
            a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. 11 And whatever town or
            village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until
            you depart. 12 As you enter the house, greet it. 13 And if the house
            is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let
            your peace return to you. 14 And if anyone will not receive you or
            listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you
            leave that house or town. 15 Truly, I say to you, it will be more
            bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah
            than for that town. 16 “Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the
            midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
            17 Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog
            you in their synagogues, 18 and you will be dragged before governors
            and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles.
            19 When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to
            speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given
            to you in that hour. 20 For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit
            of your Father speaking through you. 21 Brother will deliver brother
            over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise
            against parents and have them put to death, 22 and you will be hated
            by all for my name’s sake. But the one who endures to the end will
            be saved. 23 When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next,
            for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the
            towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. 24 “A disciple is not
            above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. 25 It is enough
            for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his
            master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how
            much more will they malign those of his household. 26 “So have no
            fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or
            hidden that will not be known. 27 What I tell you in the dark, say
            in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the
            housetops. 28 And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot
            kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in
            hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them
            will fall to the ground apart from your Father. 30 But even the
            hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear not, therefore; you are
            of more value than many sparrows. 32 So everyone who acknowledges me
            before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in
            heaven, 33 but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before
            my Father who is in heaven. 34 “Do not think that I have come to
            bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a
            sword. 35 For I have come to set a man against his father, and a
            daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her
            mother-in-law. 36 And a person’s enemies will be those of his own
            household. 37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not
            worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not
            worthy of me. 38 And whoever does not take his cross and follow me
            is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and
            whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. 40 “Whoever
            receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who
            sent me. 41 The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet
            will receive a prophet’s reward, and the one who receives a
            righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a
            righteous person’s reward. 42 And whoever gives one of these little
            ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say
            to you, he will by no means lose his reward.”
